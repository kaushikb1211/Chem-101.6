FILES NEEDED:
1) CS.exp.dat - the experimental chemical shifts file (generated by averaging the shifts for each atom in a subensemble of computed data)
2) chemical_shifts.all.csv/txt - the computational data generated for all frames of each atom
3) ligand.pdb topology file to run nmrgnn
4)  https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/19eE1t-71yJRn_G3-3wC9yDbrLVwwmKsE has the full trajectory of the ligand as well as the full chemical shifts file generated for the ligand by nmrgnn (couldn't upload files>25 MB)
